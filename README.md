## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

If you landed on this page, it probably means you came from my portfolio.

Here is a list of things you should know before getting any further.

### :dart: What HealthKerd is <a name = "is"></a>

- Very much work in progress

- A web application meant to keep track of my medical appointments and treatments.

- Relying on a MySQL database made of 64 tables using the InnoDB engine

- Far from ideal from the UI/UX standpoint, because the first objective was about gaining experience regarding backend and database

- A great opportunity to work on a bigger project without any big framework in order to strenghten my basics. When it comes to learning, I don't believe in shortcuts

- My first personal project

- A sandbox allowing me to make my mistakes and learn from them

- A project that will evolve on the long run

- A great addition to my portfolio


### :no_entry: What HealthKerd is ~~**NOT**~~<a name = "isnot"></a>

- Meant to be used by anybody but me for legal reasons, this is why the database won't be provided

- Relying on frontend or backend frameworks such as React or Symfony, but this will change in the future

## üéà Usage <a name = "usage"></a>

### Demonstration account

- The login page provides the user name and password for the demonstration account
- It gives access to a restricted account which doesn't allow to modify the user's informations
- Some links won't react to your clicks, they are just placeholders

### Doctors pages

- The doctors who's names are followed by a :key: can't be modified
- You can create, modify and delete doctors which don't have a :key:
- You can also edit their medical specialities and their attached medical offices

### Class UML

- They can be found at **```dev/UML/classULM/```**
- They come as **```.plantuml```** files

### PHP, TS & Sass files location

- PHP can be found at **```src/```**
- TypeScript can eb found at **```dev/JS & TS/TS/```**
- Sass can be found at **```dev/Sass/```**
